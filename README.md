## Hi 👋

✨ I'm a Computer Science graduate and a software developer with over 8 years of experience. I focus on building scalable microservices using Java and Go. 

👨‍💻 I love crafting cloud-ready applications that make the best use of resources.

I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as Spring services with Java 8+. 

In Go, I've worked with frameworks like Gin and Fiber. I enjoy creating REST APIs, gRPC, and event-driven systems (messaging), along with writing automated tests.

🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS and NextJS

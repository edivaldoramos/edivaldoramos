Hi 👋

✨ I'm a Computer Science graduate and a software developer with almost 10 years of experience, specializing in building scalable microservices with Java, Kotlin, and Go.

👨‍💻 I enjoy designing cloud-ready applications that are efficient and reliable, focusing on performance optimization and resource profiling, mainly on GCP and AWS.

💾 I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, and I work extensively with Spring across Java 8, 17, and 21. In Go, I've built applications using frameworks like Gin and Fiber.

🔨 My work includes developing REST APIs, gRPC services, and event-driven systems with messaging, always prioritizing clean code and automated testing.

🐳 I’m familiar with Docker and have practical experience with Kubernetes, enabling scalable and maintainable deployments.

🌱 Currently, I’m exploring ReactJS to expand my full-stack development skills.

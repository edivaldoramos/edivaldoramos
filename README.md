## Hi 👋

✨ I'm a Computer Science graduate and a software developer with over 8 years of experience, focusing on building scalable microservices using **Java** and **Go**.

👨‍💻 I love crafting cloud-ready applications that maximize resource efficiency through profiling for performance optimization.

I have experience with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases, as well as **Spring** services with **Java 8+**. 

In **Go**, I've worked with frameworks like **Gin** and **Fiber**.

🔨 I enjoy creating **REST** **APIs**, **gRPC**, and **event-driven** systems (messaging), along with writing automated tests.

I'm also familiar with **Docker** and have some experience with **Kubernetes**.

🌱 Currently, I’m learning **ReactJS** and **NextJS**.
